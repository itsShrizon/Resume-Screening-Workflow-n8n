# üìÑ Resume Screening Workflow (n8n)

This workflow automates the process of fetching resumes from **Google Drive**, analyzing them with **Google Gemini**, and recording the results in **Google Sheets**.
It is designed for screening AI Engineer candidates based on a **strict HR scoring rubric**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow Overview

The workflow performs the following steps:

1. **Trigger**

   * Searches a specified Google Drive folder for resumes.
   * Gets the latest file.

   * Extracts:

     * Candidate name
     * Email
     * University
     * Years of experience
   * Scores based on a **100-point rubric**:

     * **Experience** (20 pts)
     * **Projects** (30 pts)
     * **Technical Skills** (30 pts)
     * **Relevancy** (20 pts)
   
   * Applies deductions for:

     * Grammar, design, authenticity
     * Illogical or invalid claims
     * Incomplete education

5. **Validate JSON Output**

   * Uses a `Switch` + `Code` node to ensure Gemini output is **valid JSON**.
   * Cleans response if needed.

6. **Append Results to Google Sheets**

   * Appends candidate results into a Google Sheet with columns:

     * Name
     * Email
     * University Name
     * University Completed
     * Years of Experience
     * Score
     * Reason (Justification)

7. **Loop & Retry Mechanisms**

   * Several **Wait** and **Split In Batches** nodes handle multiple resumes and retries to avoid API errors.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Scoring Philosophy

This workflow is **strict and stingy with points**.
Candidates typically lose points if:

* Their projects are not directly related to AI/ML.
* They lack deployment/MLOps knowledge.
* They studied outside the **preferred universities** list.
* Their resume has poor grammar or design.

---

## üìå Notes

* The **preferred university list** includes BRAC, BUET, Dhaka University, NSU, SUST, and others.
* Resumes **not completed by July 2025** automatically lose **10 points**.
* JSON parsing is enforced, ensuring **clean structured output** every time.

* **Recruitment agencies** handling large candidate pools.
